Contact me if the infomation below is insufficent, i realize it is poorly documented. I intend to fix this soon


In order to use this, ensure your user has permission to access the SQL server
Download Python 3.6+ and pyodbc if needed. 
run this program using >>>python "BPM CodeSearch.py"
REPLACE the server and database options with the hardware name of your server and the specific server you want to parse

use the lower left field for your primary search criteria like OrderNum, and use the second for an additional rule, like OrderDtl
